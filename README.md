Gathered: Magic the Gathering Deckbuilder

Welcome to Gathered! A Magic the Gathering Deckbuilder.

Using an API generously provided by the Magic the Gathering community, we have developed a CLI that will allow the user to create an account and search for Magic cards by Card Name, by Creature type, by Instant Card color, and by Sorcery color. The user will then have the ability to save a card to his or her account!

We have additionally created a function whereby a user is able to create and save decks to his or her account. This is the Deckbuilder! A user will be able to create and name decks and add cards to these decks by name. We have also created the ability to add many land cards at a time to cut down on entry time.

Finally, we have given the user the ability to view his or her cards and decks!
